# Manual-Testing-E-Commerce-New-Feature
This project focused on analyzing and testing newly introduced features in an e-commerce system. I reviewed the requirement and design documents to understand the new functionalities and created targeted test cases accordingly. The focus was on test design rather than execution.
Techniques: Requirement analysis, test case design, integration testing (design-level), functional testing (design-level), UI testing (design-level), test documentation, bug prediction.
